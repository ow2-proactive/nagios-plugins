Nagios plugins to monitor ProActive based grids.

The expected directories hierarchy of the monitoring platform (where Nagios is) should be as follows: 

- /local/home/nagios/ProActiveSymbolic -> ..somewhere/ProActiveScheduling-3.1.2_server/

- /local/home/nagios/jdk -> ..somewhere/jdk1.6.0/

- /local/home/nagios/misc
  `-- ProActiveConfiguration.xml -> ..somewhere/ProActiveConfiguration.xml

- /local/home/nagios/paplugins
  |-- plugin-pamr
  |-- plugin-rest
  |-- plugin-rm
  `-- plugin-sched
