Nagios plugins to monitor ProActive based grids.

Development of the probes
----------- -- --- ------

To start developing using the probes, you can start by creating a new project for the QoSNagiosCore in your IDE, using the build.xml ant files. Its compilation should give as a result a file probecore.jar. 


Compilation of the probes
----------- -- --- ------

The jars needed by any probe include:
- probecore.jar
- <files .jar in $PROACTIVE_SCHEDULING_RESOURCING/dist/lib>

Deployment of the probes
---------- -- --- ------

The probes were designed in such a way that you can use them flexibly, specifying through command-line parameters the path of all configuration files needed. 
However, there is an easier way, using the check_* scripts provided. These scripts assume that needed file dependences have particular PATHS. If you follow this approach, there are some files you will have to write. For instance, the file env.sh should contain the definition of some environment variables such as PAUSER and PAPASS so that all probes use them. 
The expected directories hierarchy of the monitoring platform (where Nagios is) should be as follows (the symbol -> represents symbolic link):

- /local/home/nagios/env.sh               
- /local/home/nagios/ProActiveSymbolic       -> ..somewhere/ProActiveScheduling-X.X.X_server/

- /local/home/nagios/jdk                     -> ..somewhere/jdk1.6.0/

- /local/home/nagios/misc
  `-- ProActiveConfiguration.xml             -> ..somewhere/ProActiveConfiguration.xml

- /local/home/nagios/paplugins
  |-- plugin-pamr
  |-- plugin-rest
  |-- plugin-rm
  `-- plugin-sched


Example of env.sh
------- -- ------
#!/bin/bash
export PAUSER=demo
export PAPASS=demo
PROACTIVE_HOME=/home/user/Projects/ProActiveSymbolic/
