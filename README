Nagios plugins to monitor ProActive based grids.

For documentation regarding the probes, go to /docs

Deployment of the probes
---------- -- --- ------

The probes were design in such a way that you can use them as you want specifying the needed parameters and classpaths by yourself. 
However, there is an easy way of placing each needed element so that probes can start running with a minimal effort. 
The expected directories hierarchy of the monitoring platform (where Nagios is) should be as follows: 

- /local/home/nagios/ProActiveSymbolic -> ..somewhere/ProActiveScheduling-X.X.X_server/

- /local/home/nagios/jdk -> ..somewhere/jdk1.6.0/

- /local/home/nagios/misc
  `-- ProActiveConfiguration.xml -> ..somewhere/ProActiveConfiguration.xml

- /local/home/nagios/paplugins
  |-- plugin-pamr
  |-- plugin-rest
  |-- plugin-rm
  `-- plugin-sched
