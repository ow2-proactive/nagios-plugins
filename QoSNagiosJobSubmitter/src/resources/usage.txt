SYNOPSIS
   java -jar jobsubmprobe.jar --url URL --user USER --pass PASS --timeout TIMEOUT [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Nagios plugin to probe the responsiveness of a ProActive based scheduler grid.
It uses a simple job probe submission to test a grid concerning its responsiveness, and status in general.   
   
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
   
   -v, --debug LEVELOFVERBOSITY
      Verbose debugging mode level. The default value is 1. Value 3: the plugin will try to load 'log4j.properties' to know what and where to put the log messages. Value 0: silent mode. Values 1 and 2: verbose mode (shows stacktrace).
       
   -u, --user USER
      Username to get connected to the Scheduler.
      
   -p, --pass PASS
      Password to get connected to the Scheduler.
      
   -r, --url URL
      URL to be used to get connected to the Scheduler. Can be 'pamr://1' if already specified the Scheduler in the ProActive configuration file.
      It should have a format like 'rmi://shainese.inria.fr:1099/' 
       
   -t, --timeout TIMEOUT
      Timeout (in seconds) to wait for the test until killing it and telling a critical status to Nagios.
       
   -n, --timeoutwarning TIMEOUT_FOR_WARNING_MESSAGE
      In seconds. If the overall test exceeded this value, then the plugin will tell to Nagios a warning status. It is important to note that the probe is not killed with this timeout.  
      
   -f, --paconf PACONF
      ProActive configuration file (usually ProActiveConfiguration.xml). Needed if a PAMR router is present.
      
   -H, --hostname HOSTNAME
      PAMR router hostname to use to get connected to the Scheduler. Ignored if a ProActive configuration file is provided. 
      
   -x, --port PORT
      PAMR router port to be used to get connected to the Scheduler. Ignored if a ProActive configuration file is provided. 
      
   -w, --warning WARNING
      Ignored. Nagios compatibility. Warning level to be used.
      
   -c, --critical CRITICAL
      Ignored. Nagios compatibility. Critical level to be used.
      
   -d, --deleteallold
      Delete all old jobs of this user, no matter their name. For testing purposes.
   
   -j, --jobname JOBNAME
      Change the default name of the probe job. For testing purposes. 
      
   -g, --polling 
      Wait for the events like job finish and job removal by doing polling (and not using an event based mechanism). 

   -z, --highpriority
      Set the priority of the job to high (normal is default).
       
   -V, --version
      Print the version of the plugin. 
      
   -h, --help 
      Print this message.
