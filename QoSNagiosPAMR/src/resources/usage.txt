SYNOPSIS
   java -jar pamrrouterprobe.jar <paconf> <timeout> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Nagios plugin to probe the responsiveness of a ProActive based Resource Manager (RM).
It simply obtains a given number of nodes from the RM and releases them.  
   
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
   
   -v, --debug=LEVELOFVERBOSITY
      Verbose debugging mode level. Value 3: it will try to load 'log4j.properties' to know what and where to put the log messages. Value 0: silent mode. Values 1 and 2: verbose mode (shows stacktrace).
       
   -t, --timeout=TIMEOUT
      Timeout (in seconds) to wait for the test until killing it and telling a critical status to Nagios.
       
   -n, --timeoutwarning=TIMEOUT_FOR_WARNING_MESSAGE
      In seconds. If the overall test time exceeds this value, then the plugin will tell to Nagios a warning status.  
      
   -f, --paconf=PACONF
      ProActive configuration file (usually ProActiveConfiguration.xml).
      
   -H, --hostname=HOSTNAME
      Nagios compatibility. Hostname to be tested. Ignored because this information is given in the ProActive configuration file.
