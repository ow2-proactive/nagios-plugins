SYNOPSIS

   java -jar pamrrouterprobe.jar --timeout=TIMEOUT (--paconf=PACONF | --hostname=HOST --port=PORT) [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Nagios plugin to probe the PAMR router behavior. 
It creates two JVM with Active objects that communicate with each other. They exchange information that necessarily traverses the PAMR router.
If the connection with the PAMR router is not possible, or this message exchange is not correctly done, then the plugin tells the anomaly to Nagios.
   
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
   
   -v, --debug=LEVELOFVERBOSITY
      Verbose debugging mode level. Default value is 1. Value 3: it will try to load 'log4j.properties' to know what and where to put the log messages. Value 0: silent mode. Values 1 and 2: verbose mode (shows stacktrace).
       
   -t, --timeout=TIMEOUT
      Timeout (in seconds) to wait for the test until killing it and telling a critical status to Nagios.
       
   -n, --timeoutwarning=TIMEOUT_FOR_WARNING_MESSAGE
      In seconds. If the overall test time exceeds this value, then the plugin will tell to Nagios a warning status.  
      
   -f, --paconf=PACONF
      ProActive configuration file (usually ProActiveConfiguration.xml).
      
   -H, --hostname=HOSTNAME
      Hostname to be tested. Ignored if a ProActive configuration file is provided. 
      
   --port=PORT
      Port to be used to get connected to the RM. Ignored if a ProActive configuration file is provided. 
      
   -w, --warning=WARNING
      Ignored. Nagios compatibility. Warning level to be used.
      
   -c, --critical=CRITICAL
      Ignored. Nagios compatibility. Critical level to be used.
      
   -V, --version
      Print the version of the plugin.
