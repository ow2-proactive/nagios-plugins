DESCRIPTION

Nagios plugin to probe the responsiveness of a ProActive based Resource Manager (RM).
It simply obtains a given number of nodes from the RM and releases them.  
   
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
   
   -v, --debug LEVELOFVERBOSITY
      Verbose debugging mode level. Default value is 1. Value 3: it will try to load 'log4j.properties' to know what and where to put the log messages. Value 0: silent mode. Values 1 and 2: verbose mode (shows stacktrace).
       
   -u, --user USER

   -q, --nodesrequired AMOUNT_OF_NODES_TO_ASK_FOR
