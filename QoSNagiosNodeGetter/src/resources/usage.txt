SYNOPSIS
   java -jar nodegetprobe.jar <url> <user> <pass> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Nagios plugin to probe the responsiveness of a ProActive based Resource Manager (RM).
It simply obtains a given number of nodes from the RM and releases them.  
   
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
   
   -v, --debug
      Verbose debugging mode. If true it will try to load 'log4j.properties' to know what and where to put the log messages.
       
   -u, --user=USER
      Username to be used to get connected to the RM.
      
   -p, --pass=PASS
      Password to be used to get connected to the RM.
      
   --url=URL
      URL to be used to get connected to the RM. Can be 'pamr://0' if already specified the RM in the ProActive configuration file.
           
   -r, --nodes=AMOUNT_OF_NODES_TO_ASK_FOR
      Amount of nodes that will be requested to the Resource Manager.

   --nodeswarning=NODESWARNING
      If the amount of nodes obtained is strictly smaller than NODESWARNING, then a warning message will be told to Nagios.

   --nodescritical=NODESCRITICAL
      If the amount of nodes obtained is strictly smaller than NODESCRITICAL, then a critical message will be told to Nagios.

   -t, --timeout=TIMEOUT
      Timeout (in seconds) to wait for the test until killing it and telling a critical status to Nagios.
       
   -n, --timeoutwarning=TIMEOUT_FOR_WARNING_MESSAGE
      In seconds. If the overall test exceeded this value, then the plugin will tell to Nagios a warning status.  
      
   -f, --paconf=PACONF
      ProActive configuration file (usually ProActiveConfiguration.xml).
      
   -H, --hostname=HOSTNAME
      Nagios compatibility. Hostname to be tested. Ignored because this information is given in the ProActive configuration file.
      
   -w, --warning=WARNING
      Nagios compatibility. Warning level to be used.
      
   -c, --critical=CRITICAL
      Nagios compatibility. Critical level to be used.
