Nagios plugins to monitor ProActive based grids.


Compilation of the probes
----------- -- --- ------

To compile the project the environment variable PROACTIVELIB must be set in the current console. It must point to the $SCHEDULER/dist/lib directory, where $SCHEDULER is the root directory of the ProActive Scheduler of the same version of the one that is being probed. For example: 

$ export PROACTIVELIB=/home/user/ProActiveSchedulingResourcing-x.x.x_src/dist/lib

would be a valid path. Then, to compile the project just run: 

$ ant jar

Now the executable files are in bin/. Befor launching them configure accordingly the files: 

bin/env.sh
bin/login.sh

and run any of the probes. Remember to use --help as a command-line parameter if needed.
