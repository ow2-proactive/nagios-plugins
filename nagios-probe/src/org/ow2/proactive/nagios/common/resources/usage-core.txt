GENERAL NAGIOS PLUGIN FLAGS 

   -h, --help 
      Print this message. 
      
   -V, --version
      Print the version of the plugin. 

   -v, --debug LEVELOFVERBOSITY
      Verbose debugging mode level. The default value is 1. Value 3: the plugin will try to load the log4j configuration file to know what and where to put the log messages. Value 0: silent mode. Values 1 and 2: verbose mode (shows stacktrace).
       
   -w, --warning WARNING
      In seconds. If the overall test exceeded this value, then the plugin will tell to Nagios a warning status. It is important to note that the probe is not killed with this timeout.  
      
   -c, --critical CRITICAL
      Timeout (in seconds) to wait for the test until killing it and telling a critical status to Nagios (unless -W).
     
   -S, --dump-script SCRIPT-PATH
      Path of a script that is executed whenever an abnormal (not 0 return code) is thrown by the probe. It helps to dump the situation of the entity tested.  
      
   -O, --logconf LOG-CONFIG 
      Path of the log4j configuration file (if not specified or does not exist, the default log4j.properties file will be used if it exists).  
      
   -W, timeout-is-warning
      If a timeout is reached (-c TIMEOUT), instead of raising a critical status, the probe will raise a warning status.
