REST API Nagios probe.

To make it work remember to add to your JRE/JDK the certificate of the REST https server if needed.
password by default: changeit

# To check the current set of certificates installed in this JRE/JDK
keytool -list -keystore ../../Projects/jdk1.6.0_16_x64/jre/lib/security/cacerts
# Now we need to add our own certificate, so we do as following (where certificate-node0.cer is a file that we obtained from Firefox after accepting this certificate exception while trying to access to the https webpage given by the url):
chmod +w Projects/jdk1.6.0_16_x64/jre/lib/security/cacerts
keytool -import -alias myprivaterootnode0 -keystore ../../Projects/jdk1.6.0_16_x64/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file certificate-node0.cer
