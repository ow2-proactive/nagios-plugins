REST API Nagios probe.

IMPORTANT: 
To make it work remember to add to your JRE/JDK the certificate of the REST https server if needed.

PASSWORD used by the JRE/JDK to manage certificates (by default): changeit

# Check the current set of certificates installed in this JRE/JDK:
$ keytool -list -keystore ../jdk_path/jre/lib/security/cacerts

# Add our own certificate:
$ openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>&1 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > certificate.cer
$ chmod +w ../jdk_path/jre/lib/security/cacerts
$ keytool -import -alias myprivaterootnode -keystore ../jdk_path/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file certificate.cer
